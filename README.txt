I, Nikhil Krishnan, unsuccessfully tried to build a great othello AI.
I spent a lot of time on the alpha beta pruning and saved the heuristic
until the last minute, so it isn't perfect. i have ~96 points in this class before
milestone 2 yet I have some vague notion of hope that I won't fail this class.
I spent two all nighters working on this garbage AI, and I wish I had more time to finish
something that was actually competitive. I am so sorry you have to look at this.
I wish I could be better.
